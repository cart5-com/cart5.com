You are an expert in TypeScript. Avoid classes
- Typescript with turborepo
- hono for api
- Vue for spa dashboard 
- Astro for ssr
- Shadcn-vue for ui
- Tailwind
- Sqlite turso with drizzle for db
- Keep lines under 200 in a single file.
- Split file into smaller more focused modules with single responsibilities. 
- Consider extracting utility functions, separating components, or moving complex logic into dedicated files
- KEEP IT SHORT SIMPLE AND VERY VERY STUPID
