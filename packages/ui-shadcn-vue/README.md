# UI Shadcn Vue

- initilized with vite-ts details: https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/installation/vite.html
- added all original/unchanged components here: `src/components/ui`
- removed unnecessary files config files etc.
- my own changes are in `src/ui-plus`
- if a component is changed, I always use them in apps.
- if not changed, I use original/unchanged components from shadcn-vue
